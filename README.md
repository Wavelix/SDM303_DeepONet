# Project Description
This project aims to study and apply neural network-based methods for solving partial differential equations, particularly the DeepONet neural operator. By researching the basic principles of DeepONet, write Python programs to solve various common two-dimensional PDEs, and compare them with traditional discretization methods to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages.
